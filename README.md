### What I learned

This is my fifth challenge and I can definitely say I feel more comfortable when approaching each design and how I would attempt to match the them as close as possible.

### Continued development

I still feel like I need to improve this further, so I'll go back and make little adjustments. Also i feel like i need to work on making my code cleaner, and choose the best options for each design.
